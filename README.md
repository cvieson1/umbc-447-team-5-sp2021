This project will requrie **Python 3.6+**
After cloning this project create a python virtual environment and install
required packages with 

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
You likely need to run this as root/admin.

To get started make sure you have created and added a key pair to your github account,
then go ahead and clone the repo to an empty folder on your workstation.

VS Code has lots of built in tools to make using git very simple. I highly encourage 
you use them. If you need help, the official git documentation (and info on how to 
install git) is available at https://git-scm.com/


Whenever working on changes please be sure NOT to work on the main branch. 
Create and use a different branch, and when complete ask at least 1 other group 
member to review your changes before merging your branch with master - ESPECIALLY
if there are conflicting merge issues.

Do NOT push binary files to this repo. Please add folders or files containing binaries
to a new line in .gitignore (see how `venv` is already there?)

If you find yourself needing a new python library please remember to add it to requirements.txt
